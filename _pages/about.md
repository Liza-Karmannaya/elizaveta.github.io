Currently I'm a PhD candidate at the [Intelligent Social Systems Lab](https://www.mircomusolesi.org/lab/), Department of Computer Science, University College London (UCL). I am conducting my PhD research on the problem of Ethics - in humans and machines - funded by the Leverhulme Doctoral Training Programme for the Ecological Study of the Brain.
